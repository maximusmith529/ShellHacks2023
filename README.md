## What is it?
**StoryForge** is a hackathon project designed to serve as an AI game master for tabletop adventure games like D&D. A collaborative effort between Matthew Sand, Alex Harris, and Seth Lenhof, we brought StoryForge to life within a span of 36 hours, resulting in a fully functional application.

The gameplay revolves around character creation with customizable stats, immersing them in a generative world, and role-playing alongside the AI game master to explore and interact within this universe. Despite the time constraints, we managed to incorporate several features:
- A dynamic rolling system with varying difficulties
- Adaptive backgrounds that morph based on in-game time and setting
- A menu suggesting potential actions
- Basic combat mechanisms
